tctkToy read CommandLine arguments in spite of GUI application.

1 -> build & check 
2 -> help message
no option and others -> Error message

At first, run tctkToy.exe with argument “1”
It reads a .tcl file by using Tcl_EvalFile() and has some check procedure of the .tcl file.

Then, you must create the directory C:\\tctkToy to pass the 1st stage.

Challengers can pass all procedure by drag&drop a .tcl file like below. 
The directory located face.png is anywhere it can read.
