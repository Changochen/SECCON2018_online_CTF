you will get a hash value in the same way as question1, but in order to change owner address, you have to know original value of the hash.
If you take a closer look at the hash value, you will find that the value includes its contract address.
Contract address is computed as 
"sha3(rlp.encode(['transaction sender address', 'transaction sender nonce']))[12:]"
