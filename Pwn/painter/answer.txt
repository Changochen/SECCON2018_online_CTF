Floating precision error to OOB read & write

OOB read occurs in resize_img due to precision error, OOB write occurs in draw_a_line due to same reason, both in commands.cc.

Exploiter may consider tcache to OOB read and leak libc pointer. Then one can trigger underflow on pixel_array to overwrite width, height with specified color, then resize with size larger than MMAP_THRESHOLD, and overwrite libc pointers.

I used magic gadget to exploit this.
